SQL Query in Finding the Killer

SQL queries play a crucial role in this project, allowing us to filter and extract relevant data from the dataset. By carefully crafting and running these queries, we can piece together clues and evidence to identify the killer. For example, a query might help us find alibis, detect inconsistencies, or highlight suspicious activities, all of which are essential in solving the mystery.
